# BFBB Tools

This is a set of Java classes which make it easier to work with the BFBB decompilation project repository in a sensible and type-safe way.

Most of my old tools were in Python and code would get pretty chaotic and hard to mentally keep track of after a while.

The purpose of rewriting some of this in Java is to let the compiler guide me through the chaos.
